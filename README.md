# GitHub Copilot Hackathon

## Learn the basic features
- If you have not used GitHub Copilot much [start with this repository](https://github.com/eficode/copilot-microsoft-hackathon).
- If you are already familiar with most of the GitHub Copilot features, start with the [Finnish Happiness Factor](https://github.com/EficodeDemoOrg/copilot-data-analysis-exercise/)

## Try and learn more advanced features
- Exercises for testing [Copilot instruction files, prompt files, and MCP](https://github.com/EficodeDemoOrg/copilot-advanced-exercises)
- With repository the [Finnish Happiness Factor](https://github.com/EficodeDemoOrg/copilot-data-analysis-exercise/)
    - Try agent mode - can you implement the whole task with one prompt?
    - Try different models and compare results
    - Try instruction files and chat prompts
    - Try MCP server
- Define tickets and let Copilot do it for you
    - Create a memorygame and divide the development into tickets
    - Select any programming language you like
    - You can use for example these APIs for fetching images:
        - Star Wars characters API https://akabab.github.io/starwars-api/#alljson
        - Pokemon characters API https://pokeapi.co/
        - Countries API https://flagsapi.com/#quick
    - You can use sounds, background images, several players, let user select grid size etc.
    - If it is too slow to develop online by assigning the tickets to Copilot, create the tickets in IDE and run Copilot locally

## Game Challenge
- Work in groups
- Select a well known old game or create your own idea
- Plan together, let Copilot help, divide into smaller pieces, and use all hands for the development
- Use any language you like and implement it as mobile/web/desktop/command line or in any other environment
